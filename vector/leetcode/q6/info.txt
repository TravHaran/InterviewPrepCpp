Vector: Rotate ( ** Interview Question)
Title: Rotating an Array

Introduction: Array manipulation is a common operation in data processing. One of the operations is rotating the elements of an array. In this problem, the task is to rotate an array to the right by a given number of steps. A rotation on the array means that each element moves to the right, and the last element wraps around to become the first.

Objective: Given a list of integers, nums, and an integer, k, rotate the elements of nums to the right by k steps.

Detailed Requirements:

Input:

A list of integers, nums, which can be of any length, including being empty.

An integer, k, representing the number of steps to rotate the nums to the right.

Output:

There's no direct output from the function. Instead, the input list, nums, is modified in-place to reflect its rotated state.

Examples:

Example 1:

Input:

nums: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k: 3

Modified nums:

[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

Explanation:

Rotate the array 3 times. After the first rotation, the array becomes [7,1,2,3,4,5,6], and so on.

Example 2:

Input:

nums: [-1,-100,3,99], k: 2

Modified nums:

[3,99,-1,-100]

Explanation:

Rotate the array 2 times to achieve the resultant array.

Example 3:

Input:

nums: [1,2,3], k: 4

Modified nums:

[3,1,2]

Explanation:

Rotate the array 4 times. The effect of rotating the array 3 times is the same as not rotating it at all. Hence, rotating it 4 times is equivalent to rotating it once.



Tips:

If the number of rotations, k, is larger than the length of the array, we can use the modulo operation to reduce the effective number of rotations.

One efficient way to rotate an array is to use reversing. By reversing specific portions of the array in a certain order, we can achieve the desired rotation without having to move each element individually.



The problem evaluates the ability to perform array manipulations efficiently and understand the properties and patterns of the array rotation operation.
