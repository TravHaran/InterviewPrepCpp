Vector: Find Longest String ( ** Interview Question)
Title: Finding the Longest String in a List

Introduction: In many text processing tasks, finding the string with the maximum length can be crucial. This could be useful in tasks such as determining the string which takes up the most space visually, identifying outlier data points in text data, or simply categorizing data based on string length. The objective here is to efficiently identify the longest string in a given list.

Objective: Write a function that accepts a list of strings and returns the longest string from the list.

Detailed Requirements:

Input:

A list of strings (stringList). The list can have any number of strings, including being empty. There's no defined maximum length for individual strings or the list itself.

Output:

A single string that is the longest from the stringList.

If multiple strings have the same maximum length, the function will return the first one encountered.

If the list is empty, the function should return an empty string.

Examples:

Example 1:

Input:

stringList: ["apple", "banana", "kiwi"]

Output:

"banana" (since it has 6 characters, which is more than the others)

Example 2:

Input:

stringList: ["dog", "cat", "elephant"]

Output:

"elephant" (as it's the longest string with 8 characters)

Example 3:

Input:

stringList: []

Output:

"" (An empty string as the list is empty)



Tips:

Start by initializing a variable to represent the longest string as an empty string. This will serve as a reference point for comparison as you traverse the list.

Using a loop, go through each string in the list and compare its length with the length of the current longest string. If the string from the list is longer, update the longest string variable.

The loop should ensure you check each string only once, ensuring efficiency in the solution.



Remember, the goal is to find and return the longest string from the list in a single traversal without sorting or using external utilities.
