LL: Remove Duplicates ( ** Interview Question)
Implement the removeDuplicates member function for the LinkedList class, which removes all duplicate values from a singly linked list.

The function should preserve the original order of the non-duplicate elements.

Note:  This linked list class does NOT have a tail which will make this method easier to implement.



Function Signature:

void removeDuplicates()



Example:

Consider the following singly linked list:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 3 -> nullptr



For the given list, after calling the function ll.removeDuplicates(), the list should be modified to be:

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> nullptr



All duplicate values have been removed, and the remaining elements maintain their original order.
