DLL: Swap First and Last ( ** Interview Question)
Implement a member function called swapFirstLast() that swaps the values of the first and last nodes in the list.

If the length of the list is less than 2, the function should not perform any operation.

Input:
The function is a member of the DoublyLinkedList class, which has a head and a tail pointer, as well as a length attribute.



Output:
No explicit output is returned. However, the function should modify the doubly linked list such that the values of the first and last nodes are swapped.



Constraints:
The doubly linked list may be empty, have only one node, or have two or more nodes.



Example:

Consider the following doubly linked list:

Head: 1
Tail: 5
Length: 5
 
Doubly Linked List:
1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 5


After calling swapFirstLast(), the list should be:

Head: 5
Tail: 1
Length: 5
 
Doubly Linked List:
5 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 1
