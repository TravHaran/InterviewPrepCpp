DLL: Reverse ( ** Interview Question)
Implement a member function called reverse() that reverses the order of the nodes in the list.

Input:
The function is a member of the DoublyLinkedList class, which has a head and a tail pointer, as well as a length attribute.



Output:
No explicit output is returned. However, the function should modify the doubly linked list such that the order of the nodes is reversed.



Constraints:
The doubly linked list may be empty, have only one node, or have two or more nodes.



Example:

Consider the following doubly linked list:

Head: 1
Tail: 5
Length: 5
 
Doubly Linked List:
1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> 5


After calling reverse(), the list should be:

Head: 5
Tail: 1
Length: 5
 
Doubly Linked List:
5 <-> 4 <-> 3 <-> 2 <-> 1


Note that the list is reversed by updating the prev and next pointers of each node.
