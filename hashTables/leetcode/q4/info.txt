HT: Group Anagrams ( ** Interview Question)
Implement a function called groupAnagrams() that groups a list of strings based on their anagram equivalence.



Input:
The function takes a constant reference to a vector of strings strings.



Output:
The function should return a vector of vectors of strings, where each inner vector contains a group of anagram-equivalent strings. The order of the groups and the strings within the groups does not matter.



Constraints:

The input strings may contain any printable ASCII characters.

The length of each string in the input vector may range from 1 to 100.



Examples:

Consider the following input vector:

strings: {"eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"}
After calling groupAnagrams(strings), the result could be (order of groups and strings within groups does not matter):

{
    {"eat", "tea", "ate"},
    {"tan", "nat"},
    {"bat"}
}




Consider the following input vector:

strings: {"cab", "tin", "pew", "duh", "may", "ill", "buy", "bar", "max", "doc"}
After calling groupAnagrams(strings), the result could be (order of groups and strings within groups does not matter):

{
    {"cab"},
    {"tin"},
    {"pew"},
    {"duh"},
    {"may"},
    {"ill"},
    {"buy"},
    {"bar"},
    {"max"},
    {"doc"}
}




Consider the following input vector:

strings: {"hello", "world", "drolw", "lehol", "orwld"}
After calling groupAnagrams(strings), the result could be (order of groups and strings within groups does not matter):

{
    {"hello", "lehol"},
    {"world", "drolw", "orwld"}
}
