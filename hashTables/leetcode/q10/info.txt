Set: Longest Consecutive Sequence ( ** Interview Question)
Write a function called longestConsecutiveSequence.

This function takes a list of numbers as input and finds the length of the longest sequence of numbers that can be arranged in order.

For example, if the list is [2, 1, 6, 9, 4, 3], the longest sequence in order is [1, 2, 3, 4], and the length is 4.



What Do We Mean by "Sequence in Order"?

A sequence in order is a group of numbers that follow each other without any gaps. For example, 1, 2, 3, 4 is a sequence in order because they follow each other. 1, 3, 4 is not a sequence in order because there is a gap; 2 is missing.



What Do You Need to Do?

Receive a List: The function takes a list of numbers as input.

Look at Each Number: The function examines each number in the list.

Find Starting Points: The function identifies good starting points for sequences.

Check for Next Numbers: For each starting point, the function checks if the next number in the sequence is in the list.

Count Length: It keeps track of how long each sequence is.

Find Longest: The function identifies which sequence is the longest.

Return Length: Finally, the function returns the length of the longest sequence.



Input

A list of numbers stored in a vector called nums.



Output

The length of the longest sequence of numbers that can be arranged in order.



Example:

Input List

[2, 1, 6, 9, 4, 3]

Output Length

4

Why?

In this example, the longest sequence that can be arranged in order is [1, 2, 3, 4]. So, the length is 4.
