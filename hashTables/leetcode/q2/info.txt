HT: Find Duplicates ( ** Interview Question)
Implement a function called findDuplicates() that finds and returns all the duplicate elements in a given vector of integers.



Input:
The function takes a constant reference to a vector of integers nums.



Output:
The function should return a vector of integers containing all the duplicate elements in the input vector nums. The order of the elements in the output vector does not matter.



Examples:



Consider the following input vector:

nums: {1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 7, 8}
After calling findDuplicates(nums), the result should be:

{4, 5}




Consider the following input vector:

nums: {10, 20, 30, 20, 40, 50, 30}
After calling findDuplicates(nums), the result should be:

{20, 30}




Consider the following input vector:

nums: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
After calling findDuplicates(nums), the result should be:

{}
