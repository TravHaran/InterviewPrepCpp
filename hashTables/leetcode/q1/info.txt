HT: Item In Common ( ** Interview Question)
Implement a function called itemInCommon() that checks if two input vectors have at least one common item.



Input:
The function takes two vectors of integers as input parameters:

vect1: a vector of integers

vect2: a vector of integers



Output:
The function should return a boolean value indicating whether the two input vectors have at least one item in common or not.



Constraints:

The input vectors may have duplicate integers.



Examples:

Consider the following input vectors:

vect1: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
vect2: {6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
After calling itemInCommon(vect1, vect2), the result should be:

arduinoCopy code
false




Consider the following input vectors:

vect1: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
vect2: {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
After calling itemInCommon(vect1, vect2), the result should be:

true




Consider the following input vectors:

vect1: {1, 2, 2, 4, 5}
vect2: {6, 7, 8, 2, 10}
After calling itemInCommon(vect1, vect2), the result should be:

true
