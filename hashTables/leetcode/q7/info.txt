Set: Remove Duplicates ( ** Interview Question)
Write a function called removeDuplicates.

This function takes a list of numbers as input and returns a new list that has all the duplicate numbers removed.



Input

A list of numbers stored in a vector called myList.



Output

A new list of numbers, also stored in a vector, with all duplicates removed.



Example:

Input List

[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6]



Output List

[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]



Here is how the function works, step-by-step:



Start with the Original List: The function starts with the original list of numbers that may have duplicates.

Create an Empty Set: It then creates an empty set to store unique numbers.

Go Through Each Number: The function looks at each number in the original list, one by one.

Add to Set: If a number is not already in the set, it gets added. If it's already there, the function skips it.

Create a New List: Finally, the function makes a new list from the numbers in the set. The new list has all duplicates removed.

Return the New List: The function returns the new list.
