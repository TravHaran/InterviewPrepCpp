Stack: Sort Stack ( ** Interview Question)
Implement a function called sortStack() that sorts a given stack of integers in ascending order using an additional stack.



Input:
The function takes a reference to a stack of integers inputStack, with an arbitrary size.



Output:
The function should not return any value, but it should modify the input stack in-place such that the elements are sorted in ascending order, with the smallest element at the top.



Constraints:
The input stack may contain positive or negative integers. The function must use only one additional stack for sorting purposes, and no other data structures are allowed.



Examples:

Consider the following input stack:

inputStack:
5
2
7
1
After calling sortStack(inputStack), the input stack should be:

inputStack:
1
2
5
7




Consider the following input stack:

inputStack:
-3
0
4
-1
After calling sortStack(inputStack), the input stack should be:

inputStack:
-3
-1
0
4
