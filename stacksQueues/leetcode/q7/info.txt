Queue Using Stacks: Dequeue ( ** Interview Question) NEW
In the realm of data structures, a queue represents a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) mechanism, where the dequeue operation is used to remove the front-most item. Your task is to implement this dequeue operation, but not with a standard queue structure. The challenge is to implement this operation using two stacks (stack1 and stack2) to simulate the behavior of a queue.



Background:

You're provided with the QueueUsingTwoStacks class that uses two stacks (stack1 and stack2) to simulate the operations of a queue. The class contains:

A front method that returns the front-most item of the queue without removing it.

An isEmpty method that checks if the queue is empty.

An enqueue method that adds an item to the end of the queue.

A partially implemented dequeue method that you need to perfect.



Task:

Your mission is to perfect the dequeue method of the QueueUsingTwoStacks class, ensuring that it adheres to the behavior of a typical queue's dequeue operation.



Constraints:

You should strive for optimal time complexity.

Only standard stack operations (push, pop, top, and empty) are allowed.

No additional data structures or helper methods should be used.



Tips:

Reflect on the unique LIFO property of a stack and how using two of them can simulate the FIFO nature of a queue.

Examine the front method carefully. It provides a clue on how to retrieve (and remove) the front-most item using the two stacks.

For dequeue, focus on how to effectively remove the front-most item. Remember, in our setup, stack1 mainly deals with the enqueue operation, and stack2 handles the dequeue and front operations.

If stack2 is empty and a dequeue operation is requested, the items from stack1 must be transferred to stack2 in a manner that the front-most item in the queue becomes accessible at the top of stack2.
