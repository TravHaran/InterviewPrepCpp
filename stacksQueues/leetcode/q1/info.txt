Stack: Push for a Stack That Uses a Vector ( ** Interview Question)
In the Stack: Intro video we discussed how stacks are commonly implemented using a vector instead of a Linked List.

Write the push() method to add an item onto a stack that is implemented with a vector.

Input:
The function is a member of the Stack class, which has a private member stackVector, a vector<int> representing the stack.



Output:
The function should not return any value, but it should add the given value to the top of the stack.



Constraints:
The push() function should work correctly for stacks of any size, including empty stacks.



Examples:

Consider the following stack:

Stack:
5
4
3
2
1


After calling push(6) with the Stack object, the stack should look like this:

Stack:
6
5
4
3
2
1




Consider an empty stack:

Stack:


After calling push(1) with the Stack object, the stack should look like this:

Stack:
1
